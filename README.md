# Intelligent Cloud Cost Optimization Advisor with Gen AI

## Project Description

This project, the "Intelligent Cloud Cost Optimization Advisor," is designed to leverage statistical analysis, machine learning (ML), and Generative AI (Gen AI) to help users understand and optimize their cloud expenditures. The system aims to automatically detect cost anomalies, identify wasteful resources, and then provide human-like explanations and actionable recommendations for cost savings by integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). Key components include data simulation for creating realistic cloud cost scenarios, a multi-faceted anomaly detection engine using both classical time series methods  and unsupervised ML models, a rule-based system for waste identification, and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to clarify ML model decisions. The project culminates in a system that offers intelligent advice to improve cloud financial management.
